            <p class="overview">
                OpportUNITY is a finalized platform that bridges students and faculty through a centralized system for discovering and applying to research and entrepreneurial opportunities. Users can create profiles, view filtered posts, track application progress, and schedule interviews directly through the site. The platform eliminates fragmented workflows by combining key interactions—secure login, communication, and scheduling—into one seamless user experience. A structured SQL backend, integrated Google Login, SendGrid Email, and Calendar APIs support data flow and functionality throughout the site.

        Built with accessibility and usability in mind, the platform is responsive across devices and accommodates multiple user types through role-based access.
        <br><br>
        Throughout development, our team embraced an iterative design process that included collecting survey responses and conducting usability testing through live feedback sessions. These insights were critical in refining visual hierarchy, improving the clarity of the application steps, and ensuring intuitive filtering and navigation. Final touches focused on polishing the user experience, optimizing performance, and confirming database consistency. The site has been fully tested and is now ready for launch. Our goal was to build not just a tool, but a reliable, user-first platform that supports meaningful academic collaboration, enhances student access to faculty-led work, and streamlines opportunity engagement on campus.

                Virtual Pantry is made for people who need a more effective, easier, and simpler way to manage their groceries to limit waste of food and money. This app is a way for people to easily track their food expiration dates while also getting suggested meal with the ingredients they have. This gives the user the best possible duration and use of the food they have while also relieving the stress of finding a recipe with all the ingredients you have.        </p>

            <p class="overview">
                At the beginning of this class we were asked to create an app that reflects what we found about groups who use mobile or wearable technology for collaboration. To that we created Virtual Pantry, Being able to use the groceries in the real world and be able to track/organize them in your phone demonstrates a useable mobile technology. Our problem statement was "How can we make the management of groceries easier and simpler for people?". From there we built our app for people who needed to make groceries easier to track but also maximize the use of groceries so that leads to no food waste, causing less money waste as well.

                Our link below will take you to the Figma prototype of our app, it is easy to navigate through so you are able to scan a food item and add it to your virtual pantry as well as giving you suggested meals with the ingredients you have.            </p>

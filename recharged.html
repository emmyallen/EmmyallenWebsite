                Our main focus is health and well being, specifically in mental health and phone addiction. We all came together as a team to help stop phone addiction and come up with a way to combat that addiction. We created an app that is designed to help you keep up on studying, work, or even time with yourself. Through using our app, we want people to be able to regulate their screen time, increase their productivity, and overall improve their mental health. </p>
